# Project Progress

## What Works

*   Core application setup (Electron, React, Vite, TypeScript).
*   Basic UI structure with navigation.
*   Configuration loading/saving (`ConfigHelper`, settings UI).
*   API Key validation (format check, OpenAI test).
*   Screenshot capture mechanism (`ScreenshotHelper`, `Ctrl+H`).
*   Screenshot queue management (queue view, deletion).
*   Initial problem processing from screenshots (via `ProcessingHelper` -> `AIService` -> `ResponseParser`).
    *   Problem understanding generation (extracts statement, constraints, examples).
    *   Narrative solution generation (problem analysis, brute, optimized, implementation, dry run).
*   Basic behavioral question analysis:
    *   Loading LPs and stories.
    *   Extracting relevant LPs from the question.
    *   Selecting the most relevant story using AI.
    *   Displaying the selected story and reasoning.
*   **Detailed behavioral story generation:**
    *   Backend IPC handler (`generate-behavioral-story-detail`) functional.
    *   UI trigger (button) and display area implemented.
    *   Markdown rendering of detailed story.
    *   Scrolling for long narratives.
*   **Functional behavioral follow-up:**
    *   Backend IPC handler (`process-behavioral-follow-up`) functional.
    *   UI input and display implemented.
*   Build process includes cleaning steps.
*   IPC handler initialization includes robust logging.

## What's Left

*   Testing:
    *   **Thoroughly test the detailed story generation feature.**
    *   Test behavioral follow-up quality.
    *   Test overall application stability and edge cases.
*   Features:
    *   **Implement "Technical Details" side column for behavioral stories.**
    *   Refine AI prompts for better quality/consistency (understanding, narrative, behavioral selection/detail/follow-up).
    *   Implement anticipated follow-up question generation and display (coding & behavioral).
    *   Implement solution refinement based on user feedback/debugging.
    *   (Stretch) Add ability to edit/save generated stories or narratives.
    *   (Stretch) Implement credit tracking/usage system.
*   UI/UX:
    *   Improve status update feedback during processing.
    *   General UI polish and refinement.
*   Code Quality:
    *   Refactor shared types (e.g., `BehavioralStory`).
    *   Review error handling across IPC calls.

## Potential Blockers / Risks

*   AI prompt effectiveness/consistency.
*   Handling complex or ambiguous coding problems/screenshots.
*   API costs/rate limits.
*   Cross-platform compatibility issues (shortcuts, windowing).

*   Further enhanced AI prompt to require detailed explanatory comments in generated code.
*   Changed `Solutions.tsx` layout from 2x2 grid to vertical stack (`flex-col`).

## üöß What's Being Worked On

*   Implement UI/logic for follow-up questions via a text area after initial solution generation.

## üìù What's Left / Backlog

*   Locate the core code/prompt responsible for generating the initial solution from screenshot context.
*   Modify this prompt to include a critical clarification step (analyze ambiguity, ask questions/state assumptions if needed).
*   Test the new clarification-first AI response flow.
*   General UI/UX Improvements for Solutions view.
*   Define subsequent development tasks/goals (via Planner Mode).

# Project Brief: CodeInterviewAssist

**Goal:** To create and maintain a free, open-source AI-powered interview preparation tool that serves as a viable alternative to expensive commercial platforms.

**Problem Solved:** High-cost subscription models for premium coding interview tools create barriers for students and job seekers. This project aims to democratize access to essential AI-driven preparation features (problem analysis, solution generation, debugging) by allowing users to run the tool locally, using their own API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini), ensuring privacy and affordability.

**Scope:** The core focus is on providing AI assistance for coding problems encountered during interviews, primarily through screenshot analysis. It emphasizes local processing, user privacy, and community-driven development and extension.

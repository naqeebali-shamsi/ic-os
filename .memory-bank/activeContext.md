**Last Updated:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S)

‚úÖ **Recent Changes:**

*   Enhanced AI prompt (`prompts.ts` -> `getFourQuadrantPrompt`) to require detailed, human-like comments within the generated `code` explaining the thought process for each step.
*   Changed `Solutions.tsx` layout from 2x2 grid to vertical stack (`flex-col`).

üß† **Next Steps:**

1.  Implement UI/logic for follow-up questions via a text area after initial solution generation.
2.  Locate the core code/prompt responsible for generating the initial solution from screenshot context.
3.  Modify this prompt to include a critical clarification step:
    *   AI should first analyze the problem description for ambiguity.
    *   If ambiguous, respond with clarifying questions and stated assumptions (fitting into the existing response structure where possible, e.g., in "Problem Understanding").
    *   If clear, proceed with generating the full solution.
4.  Test the modified clarification/solution flow using screenshots.

‚ùó **Active Decisions / Context:**

*   Shifted focus to supporting verbally presented, potentially ambiguous interview problems, moving beyond well-structured sources like LeetCode.
*   The AI's primary response to a screenshot should prioritize clarification (asking questions, stating assumptions) if the problem is unclear, *before* generating a full solution.
*   The user interaction loop for clarification will be managed externally by the user (take screenshot, review AI response, update external notes/code, repeat with new screenshot).
*   The `Solutions.tsx` UI will display either the clarification questions or the full solution based on the AI's response, using the vertical layout.
*   Follow-up questions via a dedicated text area are now the active focus.
*   The core AI analysis flow uses a single prompt requesting a JSON object with four main keys (problemUnderstanding, bruteForceApproach, optimalSolutionPseudocode, optimalSolutionAnalysis).
*   AI prompt now also requests detailed, explanatory comments within the generated code.

‚úÖ **Completed detailed codebase exploration and updated Memory Bank.**
*   Identified available Gemini models in settings (`1.5 Pro`, `2.0 Flash`).
*   Added `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25` as a selectable Gemini model option in `SettingsDialog.tsx`.
*   Successfully tested the selection and functionality of the `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25` model in the application.

‚ùó **Active Decisions / Context:**

*   `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25` is confirmed working within the application.
*   Kept `gemini-1.5-pro` as the default selection for the Gemini provider.

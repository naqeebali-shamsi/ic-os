**Last Updated:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S)

‚úÖ **Recent Changes:**

*   Defined next goal: Implement a four-quadrant UI for displaying AI analysis.
*   Updated AI prompts (`prompts.ts`) to request the four-quadrant structure in JSON format.
*   Refactored `SolutionProcessor.ts` to use the new single prompt and call a new parser.
*   Added `FourQuadrantData` type and `parseFourQuadrantResponse` function to `ResponseParser.ts`.
*   Refactored `src/_pages/Solutions.tsx` to use `useState`, listen for `SOLUTION_SUCCESS`, and render the four quadrants using a reusable `QuadrantCard` component in a 2x2 grid.
*   Added display for Optimal Complexity and Thinking Process below the main grid.
*   Tested the four-quadrant UI implementation.
*   Fixed `Solutions.tsx` layout issue by removing `flex-grow` and `min-h-0` from the main grid container.
*   Fixed `Solutions.tsx` listener churn by removing `solutionData` from `useEffect` dependencies.
*   Improved visual hierarchy in `Solutions.tsx` by making section titles bold and white.
*   Enhanced AI prompt (`prompts.ts` -> `getFourQuadrantPrompt`) to request a more narrative, "thinking out loud" style explanation and potential visualizations within the `thinkingProcess` field.
*   Further enhanced AI prompt (`prompts.ts` -> `getFourQuadrantPrompt`) to require detailed, human-like comments within the generated `code` explaining the thought process for each step.

üß† **Next Steps:**

*   Test the enriched content generation (run a problem through the tool, check both `thinkingProcess` and code comments).
*   Further UI/UX refinements based on testing.

‚ùó **Active Decisions / Context:**

*   The core AI analysis flow now uses a single prompt requesting a JSON object with four main keys.
*   The `Solutions.tsx` component relies on `useState` and IPC events for displaying data.
*   The four-quadrant layout is functional after CSS adjustments.
*   IPC listener management in `Solutions.tsx` is stable.
*   Section/Card titles in `Solutions.tsx` are now styled (`font-bold`, `text-white`).
*   AI prompt now requests richer, more human-like thinking process details and visualizations.
*   AI prompt now also requests detailed, explanatory comments within the generated code.

‚úÖ **Completed detailed codebase exploration and updated Memory Bank.**
*   Identified available Gemini models in settings (`1.5 Pro`, `2.0 Flash`).
*   Added `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25` as a selectable Gemini model option in `SettingsDialog.tsx`.
*   Successfully tested the selection and functionality of the `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25` model in the application.

‚ùó **Active Decisions / Context:**

*   `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25` is confirmed working within the application.
*   Kept `gemini-1.5-pro` as the default selection for the Gemini provider.

# Project Progress: CodeInterviewAssist

**Overall Status:** Active Development/Enhancement

**Last Updated:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S)

## ‚úÖ What Works / Completed Milestones

*   **Code Cleanup (Types):** Moved shared types (`BehavioralStory`, `AmazonLP`) to `electron/types.ts`.
*   **Behavioral Assistant Testing:** Verified end-to-end flow (Selection, Reasoning, Follow-up, Detail Generation) is functional.
*   **Fixed AI Service Call:** Resolved `TypeError` in `generate-behavioral-story-detail` handler by using `aiService.generateCompletion()` instead of `generateText`.
*   **Fixed API Key Retrieval:** Resolved `TypeError` in `generate-behavioral-story-detail` handler by using `configHelper.loadConfig().apiKey`.
*   Memory Bank Initialized
*   Core Project Context Documented
*   Detailed Codebase Exploration Completed
*   `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25` added to Settings UI & Tested Working
*   Implemented Four-Quadrant UI concept (subsequently changed).
*   Tested four-quadrant UI implementation and verified AI response/parsing.
*   Fixed layout issues in `Solutions.tsx`.
*   Fixed listener churn issues in `Solutions.tsx`.
*   Improved visual hierarchy in `Solutions.tsx` section/card titles.
*   Enhanced AI prompt (`getFourQuadrantPrompt`) for richer "thinking process" content.
*   Further enhanced AI prompt to require detailed explanatory comments in generated code.
*   Changed `Solutions.tsx` layout from 2x2 grid to vertical stack (`flex-col`).
*   Implemented UI/logic for follow-up questions (Coding).
*   Fixed TypeScript errors related to `mainWindow` and `FourQuadrantData`.
*   Applied frosted glass background.
*   Corrected text color contrast in `Solutions.tsx`.
*   Refactored solution generation to use narrative flow (Backend: `SolutionProcessor`, `ResponseParser`, `prompts`).
*   Updated `Solutions.tsx` frontend for narrative display.
*   Refactored follow-up logic for narrative flow (Coding).
*   Fixed various build errors (TS, JSX) post-refactor.
*   Fixed markdown newline rendering.
*   Implemented Two-Step Confirmation Flow (Backend & Frontend).
*   Added problem understanding prompts (`getProblemUnderstandingPrompt`, `getRefinedUnderstandingPrompt`) and parsers.
*   Added IPC handlers (`submit-user-clarification`, `trigger-solution-generation`) and preload APIs.
*   Implemented confirmation/clarification UI in `Solutions.tsx` and integrated skip-flow logic.
*   Confirmation flow tested end‚Äëto‚Äëend (User sees understanding, confirms, and solution appears).
*   Clarification loop tested end‚Äëto‚Äëend (Submit Clarification refines the understanding data).
*   Skip‚Äëflow tested end‚Äëto‚Äëend (Examples present ‚Üí Direct solution without confirmation screen).
*   Follow-up question integration tested end‚Äëto‚Äëend (Coding).
*   **Behavioral Question Assistant (Steps 1-4):**
    *   Populated JSON data stores (`amazon_lps.json`, `behavioral_stories.json`).
    *   Shortcut (`CmdOrCtrl+Shift+B`) and Mode (`coding`/`behavioral`) switching implemented.
    *   UI component (`BehavioralAssistant.tsx`) created and integrated for initial question/result.
    *   Backend IPC channel (`process-behavioral-question`) defined.
*   **Behavioral Question Assistant (Step 5 - AI Selection):**
    *   Implemented AI Workflow for LP extraction and story selection in `ipcHandlers.ts`.
    *   Added relevant prompts (`getBehavioralLPExtractionPrompt`, `getBehavioralStorySelectionPrompt`) to `prompts.ts`.
    *   Removed story generation fallback.
*   **Behavioral Question Assistant (Follow-up):**
    *   Added UI elements for follow-up in `BehavioralAssistant.tsx`.
    *   Added IPC handler (`process-behavioral-follow-up`) and prompt (`getBehavioralFollowUpPrompt`).
    *   Updated preload and types.
*   **Resolved Build Issues:** Successfully resolved persistent build errors related to module exports/imports by:
    *   Moving `prompts.ts` into `electron/` directory.
    *   Extracting shared types (`ProblemInfo`, `ProblemExample`) into `electron/types.ts` to break circular dependencies.
    *   Correcting a syntax error (unterminated comment) in `electron/prompts.ts`.
    *   Ensuring build process (`npm run build`) relies solely on `vite build` (removed redundant `tsc` call).
*   **Data File Handling:** Configured `extraResources` in `package.json` and updated path logic in `ipcHandlers.ts` for loading data files (`amazon_lps.json`, etc.).
*   **Runtime Data Loading (Dev):** Successfully fixed `ENOENT` error for loading `amazon_lps.json`/`behavioral_stories.json` in development environment (`stealth-run.bat`) by using `__dirname` for path resolution in `electron/ipcHandlers.ts`.

## üöß What's Being Worked On

*   *(None currently active - next steps defined in activeContext.md)*

## üöÄ What's Left / Backlog

*   General UI/UX Improvements for Solutions view (contrast, styling, accessibility).
*   Address UI contrast issues in `Queue.tsx`.

## üöß What's In Progress / Needs Refinement

*   **Error Handling:** More robust error display and recovery across flows.
*   **UI Polish:** Consistent styling, loading states, transitions (especially in Behavioral Assistant).
*   **Debugging Flow (Full):** Implementing the AI call and response parsing for debug analysis.
*   **Credits System:** Full integration with actual usage and potential backend.
*   **Stealth/Compatibility:** Testing and improving undetectability across platforms/interview tools.

## ‚è≥ What's Left / Future Features

*   **Refined Debugging:** Displaying debug analysis effectively in the UI.
*   **Language Support:** Ensuring prompts and parsing work well for multiple languages.
*   **Model Flexibility:** Testing and ensuring compatibility with different specified models (GPT-4o, mini, Gemini, Claude etc.).
*   **Configuration:** More granular settings (e.g., temperature, custom prompts?).
*   **Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests.
*   **Documentation:** User guide, contribution guidelines.
